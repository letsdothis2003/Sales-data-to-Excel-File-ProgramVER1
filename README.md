# Sales-data-to-Excel-File-ProgramVER1
Made this during my 2nd year of college as I took a java class. This program takes data regarding sales, purchases or just inventory and outputs that into a excel file. Its a very primitive, I know. Feel free to improve on what I started, I myself will try to improve on it and send updated versions during my freetime. 

Version 2 is coming out as I am aware that a lot of the java stuff I was taught in college and highschool is very outdated.
