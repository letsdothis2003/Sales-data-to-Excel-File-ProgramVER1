# Sales-data-to-Excel-File-ProgramVER1
Made this during my 2nd year of college as I took a java class. This program takes data regarding sales, purchases or just inventory and outputs that into a excel file. Its a very primitive, I know. Feel free to improve on what I started, I myself will try to improve on it and send updated versions during my freetime. 

This video helped me out when it came to implementing apache:

I am working on a version 2 because the java classes I took in college and highschool taught me very  outdated material(basically, I will switch to javafx in the future iteration).
