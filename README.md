# Sales-data-to-Excel-File-ProgramVER1
Made this during my 2nd year of college as I took a java class. This program takes data regarding sales, purchases or just inventory and outputs that into a excel file. Its a very primitive, I know. Feel free to improve on what I started, I myself will try to improve on it and send updated versions during my freetime. 

If you want to run and try it out, first get eclipse or something similar to that and modify properties so it can run Apache API. Heres a video documenting how to do that:

Sorry for not configuring it so if one were to download it, they would have a properly configured version thats runnable or a runnable JAR version.
